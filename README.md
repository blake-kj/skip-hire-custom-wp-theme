# Custom WordPress Theme

I followed this [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLhnubqavDg) on how to create a custom WordPress theme for a skip company based in Australia.

### Project Description

The tutorial started with using the understrap WordPress theme. As the tutorial is 3 years old, understrap has since moved away from gulp and instead uses postcss to compile which meant some differences in getting started with the tutorial. I expanded on the tutorial by implementing swiperjs in order for the homepage hero to swipe through a number of heros.

I found the tutorial challenging at times, as not everything was covered. However, this meant I had to rely on doing my own research which further developed my skills.

### Theme Description

- The theme uses Bootsrap 5 and sass for structure, styling and some components e.g. mobile menu (Bootstrap)
- Custom JavaScript and jQuery were used to add functionality where a user can start entering their suburb or postcode and be shown a list of delivery locations to choose from. The use can then select the correct location and then be shown a list of different skip sizes to choose from with the relevant pricing based on their location.
- Advanced Custom Fields plugin was utilised in order to add extra fields to each product e.g. the dimensions of each skip.
- Woocommerce & Checkout Fields Editor was used to offer custom checkout functionality.
- A working blog with two posts has been implemented in addition to separate about and contact pages.

### What's Next?

Having completed this tutorial and extended the theme with some additional functionality, I will now design and create my own WordPress theme using what I have learnt in this tutorial in my own project. I am hoping to create a cleaner, modern design for a site that has similar functionality to what is present in this theme, to show off my skills to potential clients and agencies!
